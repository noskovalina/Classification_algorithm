# Classification_algorithm
In this project, I developed a classification algorithm based on probabilistic models.

In fact, this is a version of the famous Naive Bayes classifier. Of course, this classifier is far from perfect: for example, it completely ignores words and only deals with characters and their frequencies. However, it works pretty well despite being so simple. It also shows several important concepts: probability, maximum likelihood estimate, Bayesian estimates, and so on.

The data for the project is a set of texts in English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Polish and Portuguese obtained from random Wikipedia articles.
